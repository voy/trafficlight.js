# Traffic Light

A little server built using Node.js, which polls Jenkins jobs and displays 
red or green light based on build status. The light updates automatically 
using socket.io. 

Best used on a big screen TV to help stay on top of your unit tests etc.

### Installation

```sh
$ npm install https://github.com/voy/traffic-light/tarball/master
```

### Usage

```sh
$ npm start
```
